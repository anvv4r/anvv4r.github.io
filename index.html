                    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a Full-stack Web Developer, Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast. I studied web
                        development and data science at Data4You, z.s. in Czechia. I have experience in web development,
                        machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization project. I am open to learn new
                        technologies and enjoy working with people who are as passionate as me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey in IT commenced with a role as a Web Server and Content Manager at Eurolinkmedia
                        International, a Jakarta-based start-up. Since departing in 2010, I have thrived as a web
                        developer on a freelance basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another area where I gained significant experience was in journalism. My journey began in 1997
                        when I joined Suara Mahasiswa UI. This organization published an annual student magazine and a
                        daily bulletin named &quot;bergerak!&quot; during the 1998 era of Indonesian political history.
                        In 1999, I interned at Bakrie Pension Fund and contributed as a writer for their annual
                        magazine. From 2003 to 2007, I was involved in the publication of several magazines, including
                        Figur Publik Magazine, Depok Metro Magazine, and TaSYA Kids Magazine. My journalistic journey
                        culminated in a teaching role at the State University of Jakarta, where I taught News Writing
                        from 2007 to 2009 as a non-permanent lecturer.

                    <p>
                        I like photography, music, and walking. If I do not develop, you can find me strolling around
                        Prague doing photo hunt.
