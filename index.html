                <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
                <p>
                    As a full-stack web developer, I possess a strong familiarity with
                    web architecture, various web platforms, and content management
                    systems (CMS). My journey in IT commenced with a role as a Web
                    Server and Content Manager at Eurolinkmedia International, a
                    Jakarta-based start-up. Since departing in 2010, I have thrived as a
                    web developer on a freelance basis. I am passionate about my job and
                    my personal contribution to the world of modern web design. I like
                    nothing more than telling stories with the help of photography, that
                    celebrate simplicity and creativity. Currently, my interests have
                    shifted towards Data Science, prompting me to engage in both online
                    and offline related courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my other experiences, I was involved in the
                    establishment, launch, and managing of two Cyber Cafes, known as
                    emiNET Cafe - internet and coffee house, from 2007 to 2009.
                    Subsequently, I ventured into the food industry and created a
                    Chinese Food Outlet named HOTPLATE Inc., with the tagline &quot;the
                    hotter the better&quot;. This outlet was a part of the Kemang Food
                    Fest in Jakarta, and it operated from 2008 to 2014.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another area where I gained significant experience was in
                    journalism. My journey began in 1997 when I joined Suara Mahasiswa
                    UI. This organization published an annual student magazine and a
                    daily bulletin named &quot;bergerak!&quot; during the 1998 era of
                    Indonesian political history. In 1999, I interned at Dana Pensiun
                    Bakrie and contributed as a writer for their annual magazine. From
                    2003 to 2007, I was involved in the publication of several
                    magazines, including Figur Publik Magazine, Depok Metro Magazine,
                    and TaSYA Kids Magazine. My journalistic journey culminated in a
                    teaching role at the State University of Jakarta, where I taught
                    News Writing from 2007 to 2009 as a non-permanent lecturer.
